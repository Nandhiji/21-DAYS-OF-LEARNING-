{public static void main --- the hole time 

java program is run by JVM (Java Virtual Machine), not by us.

So JVM has some rules.
public static void main exists because JVM demands it.
}

main-->
What is main?

main is a method;
JVM always starts execution from main;-->Without main, JVM does not know where to start;
--->>>(main is the entry point of a Java program.)

public-->>
accessible from everywhere
❌ If you remove public:
➡️ Runtime Error

👉 --public allows JVM to access main.

static-->>>
static means no object needed.
static allows JVM to call main without creating an object.

void-->>
void means returns nothing.
JVM does not expect any value from main

Program execution ends there

👉 Simple line:

void means main gives no output back to JVM.


String[]args-->>
It is an array of strings.
Used to take command-line input.
JVM passes arguments while running program
String[] args stores command-line inputs.

🧠 FULL MEANING IN ONE SENTENCE (IMPORTANT)

public static void main is the method that JVM can access,
 run without an object, return nothing, and start program execution.

 ****--->>>>public static void main is the entry point of a Java program.
It is public so JVM can access it, static so JVM can call it without creating an object,
 and void because it does not return any value.
