today we have to do some pattern problems.

first we have to note ;
1. how many rows are there
2. how many coloums are there
   a. static patterns (row == coloums)
   b.dynamic patterns(row!= coloums) --> row + coloums relate to create a formula;
3.print what they asked ( whatever like star(*) or numbers);--->> should be print in the inside the inner loop;


and also the array concept:

find largest number, and find temperature;
